# Blury Loading

This project demonstrates how to create an image blurring effect using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The effect gradually clears as the number on the screen reaches 100%.

## How it works

The blurring effect is achieved using CSS filters, while the JavaScript code updates the number on the screen and gradually removes the filter as the number approaches 100%.

## Viewing the project

To view the project, simply download the files and open the index.html file in a web browser. The project has been tested on the latest versions of Chrome, Firefox, and Safari.
